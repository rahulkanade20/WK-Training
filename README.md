WK training repo

This repository has all the code which I did as a part of hands-on during our training at Wolters Kluwer

The repository consists of 4 main folders - 

Assignments

Java

Python , Javascript and Java folders consists of all the code related to what Nagraj sir taught us during our training sessions (for all the concepts, practical implementation was carried out).

The 'Assignments' folder consists of code for all the tasks given by Nagraj sir as assignments (for javascript tasks there is a .js file and a corresponding .html file) which we were suppoded to complete on our own.

The 'Assignments' folder also consist of the mini project 'Patient_Management_System' under the folder name Flask_Project which is a flask application.
